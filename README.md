Abstract:

Boom cranes are widely used in various industrial sectors to handle heavy materials. Al-
though mechanically simple, this type of crane is a non-linear and under-actuated system.
This characteristic makes the design of adequate control laws for this type of mechanical
system complicated, as a detailed knowledge of the dynamic model of the system to be con-
trolled is necessary. To solve this problem, this thesis proposes an easy-to-use methodology
to perform the identification of the dynamic model of a boom crane. The proposed study
covers all the necessary steps to make the proposed methodology as general as possible and
easily deployable. The mechanical design of a pre-existing boom crane is analysed and some
improvements are implemented. A detailed analysis of the actuators used to control the
prototype under consideration is then carried out. Based on these two preliminary results,
the procedure for performing the crane model identification is described. Real experiments
were eventually performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.
